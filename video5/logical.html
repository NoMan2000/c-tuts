<h1>Logic Control</h1>

<h2>if Statement</h2>

<p>FORM: </p>

<pre><code>    if ( condition == true ){
        statement;
    }</code></pre>

<p><strong>INTERPRETATION:</strong>  If a tested condition evaluates to true (a nonzero value), then the statement within the braces is executed.  Otherwise, it skips over the braces and nothing happens.</p>

<p>You can either hand trace the execution or you can use bc to make some quick tests and make sure that your statements are correct.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>if with else</h2>

<p>The semantics mean to execute a code block if the tested condition evaluates to true.  If the tested condition evaluates to false, then execute the else statement.</p>

<pre><code>    if ( condition == true ){
        statement ;
    }
    else{
    statement;
    // the else statement executes when the default statement is false.
    }</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>if with else if</h2>

<p>If with else if is used to specify multiple conditions that need to be tested.  The format is:</p>

<pre><code>    if (condition1 == true){
        statement1;
        statement2;
    }else if(condition2 == true){
        statement1;
        statement2;

    }else{
        statement1;
        statement2;
    }</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Switch statements</h2>

<p>Switch statements are used to evaluate large amounts of logic without having to use a bunch of else if statements.  There are a few gotchas with switch statements.  The first is that switch statements only work with either individual characters or integers.  As we have seen, a character is really an integer to C.  </p>

<pre><code>    switch(case){
        case 1:
            statement1;
            statement2;
            break;
        case 2:
            statement1;
            statement2;
            break;
        case 3:
            statement1;
            statement2;
        case4:
            statement1;
            statement2;
            statement3;
        break;
        default:
            statement1;
    }</code></pre>

<p>The other gotcha deals with the break statement.  The break statement exits out of the statement block.  If a statement does not have a break at the end of it, the code will &quot;fall through&quot;, meaning that it will simply continue executing the next line of code.  Some programming languages like C# disallow the use of falling through because they found it produces more errors than it saves time.</p>
